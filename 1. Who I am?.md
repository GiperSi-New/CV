## My name is Dzmitry.

Let's start with the main thing, I will introduce myself. My name is **Dzmitry**, I use the pseudonym or nickname ***GiperSi***, and some derivatives from it.
I was born on the third of February one thousand nine hundred and ninety-six, it is not difficult to calculate that at the time of this writing, I am ***25*** years old.
I am from Belarus, the city of [Gomel](https://www.google.com/maps/place/%D0%93%D0%BE%D0%BC%D0%B5%D0%BB%D1%8C/@52.4249312,30.8108272,11z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x46d4699b50faf1a5:0x5ecca30fd2361396!8m2!3d52.4313388!4d30.99367 "Гомель"), was born and live here to this day. I wish to visit different countries, but I have no desire to move anywhere.
I am fond of programming, mathematics, foreign languages, literature on fantasy universes, creating something new, or coming up with new ideas, possible ways and means of implementation for different fields of activity.
#
I have not decided on the **programming language**, therefore, I study and consolidate the basics in several at once: *Java*, *Python*, *C++*.
I am also studying Front-end, I am familiar with *HTML5* and *CSS3*, with their differences from previous generations and with the basics of *JS*.
#
**Mathematical sciences** are interesting in themselves, I studying for myself, I studied at the mathematical faculty at the university. I could not complete this training for personal reasons, but did not give up in the hope of finishing this course later.
#
I study **foreign languages**.
In terms of importance, I give preference to English, but there is no particular desire to learn it, which slows down the process.
In addition to English, I study Japanese and Chinese, I also started to study German, and I plan to study Italian, Spanish or French in the future.
#
Of course, I read different **literature**, in most cases educational, but I also like literature on gaming or just interesting and large fantasy universes.
#
### In general, this is all that I would like to tell about myself at this stage.
